### About
As someone with a lot of goals, whether professional, personal, or otherwise, I sometimes find it challenging to keep track of everything. Am I advancing in my studies? Am I improving my fitness? Am I excelling at work and moving toward better roles?

In today's world full of distractions, it's never been so easy to lose sight of what really matters. That's why I created Goalminder, to get those little reminders that maybe I'm getting too confortable and I should be taking action on the important things, instead of being distracted. To focus on the signal, not the noise.

### What did I learn with this project?
I ended up learning many valuable technical skills with this project:
- React: I built dynamic, reusable UI components that make the interface more interactive and responsive.
- Next.js: I learned to use server-side rendering and static site generation, boosting both performance and SEO.
- Firebase: I gained practical experience with a document database, authentication and image storage, learning a lot about backend and database cloud integration.
- Tailwind CSS: I learned to efficiently style and layout web pages.
- Figma: I improved my design skills, creating intuitive interfaces and prototypes.

But also soft skills:
- Effort: Solving bugs and implementing the system I had in mind took me a whole lot more time than I imagined when I drew the first draft.
- Patience: Probably the most I've even had to have for a project, so many little things that wouldn't work, but in the end it was worth it.
- Searching: Having never worked with React or Firebase before I had to search and read a lot about their documentation and implementations.
